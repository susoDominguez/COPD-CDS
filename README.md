# COPD-DSS
A clinical decision support system that uses evidence-based recommendations from GOLD cOPD 2017 to manage COPD symptoms. In particular, the system provides a personalised assessment of the COPD severity of the patient to then review the current COPD treatment by suggesting one or more patient-specific care plans to treat COPD when CKD or CVD are present.

The system is built on top of MAGE-DSS, a Microservice Architecture for Guideline Embedding in Decision Support Systems, using the Transition-based Medical Representation language to represent, and reason about, GOLD COPD 2017.
